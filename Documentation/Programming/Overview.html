        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>Over the years, Team 5103, the Jaegernauts, has grown tremendously. This past season alone, we've gained
            invaluable knowledge that has driven our success in FRC 2025. We believe this insight shouldn't stay
            with us—it should be shared with other FRC teams, especially those just starting out. Our goal is not
            only to create a more competitive and inclusive playing field but also to inspire the next great
            team—one that, like us, will one day pay it forward by sharing their own knowledge with the community.
        </p>

        <h2>Contents</h2>
        <p class="SpecialParagraph">This documentation is your guide to building your first robot program! While our
            main focus is Java, we’ll also dive into the worlds of C++ and LabVIEW when needed, giving you a
            well-rounded foundation in FRC programming. Get ready to explore, learn, and bring your robot to life!
        </p>

        <h2>Introduction to Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>In FRC, teams typically use Java, C++, or LabVIEW for robot programming. Each language has its strengths,
            and understanding all three will provide a solid foundation for building your robot.</p>
