                    Our team consists of 33 active members, two coaches, several mentors, and amazing parents who all support our team to the fullest. The structure of our team is split into four groups:

                    <p>Build is the biggest part of our team, where we build the robot itself. Once the design team creates a blueprint, the build section follows it to create the robot that will perform during the competition.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The design section of the team is our starting point of every competition season. They are in charge of researching potential design components of our robot and drafting blueprints and CAD models for build to reference. As the season progresses, they monitor the progress of the robot and update its design as needed.</p>

                    <p>Our programming section creates the scripts for the robot to run. They are the software engineers, though they also collaborate with the build members to make the electrical engineering work. </p>
